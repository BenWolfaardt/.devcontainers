# `.devcontainers`

A collection of my various `.devcontainer` configs

## Overview

To get up and running without much effort and on any machine `.devcontainers` are here to make our lives much easier

## TODOs

- [ ] Don't use `root` user in `devcontainer.json`
- [ ] Get the features tested and hopefully working for python
- [ ] Figure out if housing multiple devcontaners in one repo is an issue
  - [ ] I `cd` into the language folder before trying to run the devcontainer

## Useful VSCode commands

```bash
  > dev containers: rebuild without cache and reopen in container
  > dev containers: reopen in container
  > dev containers: reopen folder locally
```
